# git-screened - Automating Github Repository Assessment.
{\tt git-inspired} is a [web-app](http://git-screened.icu:5000/) that automatically scrapes summary statistics for an input Github repository and classifies it relative to the industry standard. By industry standard, I mean the most popular 5000 Python repositories on Github by star count. This web-app is intended to assist those screening candidates (HR, hiring managers, etc.), and give quick metrics to aid the process. This project was completed over the Summer 2018 Insight Data Science program.
